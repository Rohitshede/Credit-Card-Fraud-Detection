# Credit Card Fraud Detection
## Credit Card Fraud Detection
Problem statement
The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, we will analyse customer-level data which has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle Website website and it has a total of 2,84,315 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, so it needs to be handled before model building.

# Sampling Techniques
## Undersampling: Randomly removes samples from the majority class to balance class distributions.
## Oversampling SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique): Generates synthetic examples in the minority class using nearest neighbors to balance class distributions.

# Algorithms
## Logistic Regression: A linear model for binary classification.
## Decision Tree: A tree-based model that partitions the feature space into subsets.
## Random Forest: An ensemble of decision trees that improves generalization and reduces overfitting.

# Evaluation Metrics
## Accuracy Score: Measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions.
Precision Score: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
Recall Score: Measures the proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positive instances.
F1 Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning algorithms and sampling techniques in detecting credit card fraud. By evaluating multiple models using various metrics, it provides insights into the performance and robustness of each approach.
